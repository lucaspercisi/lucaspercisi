🎓 I hold a degree in Computer Science, and my academic research centered around detecting fake reviews using machine learning techniques.
🛠 I'm experienced in C#, .NET, ASP.NET (MVC), Windows Forms, and leveraging tools such as Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Redmine, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Visual Studio. I’m currently using .NET 8 and MudBlazor for my latest projects.
🤔 I’m passionate about software architecture, ensuring quality and efficiency, and migrating legacy systems to modern solutions.
